Sorta just going through the motions, cant remember what I found out in this experiment honestly didn't write it down anywhere. Probably bc then I would have had to start wondering about all the hard math, since I dont think my brain can handle it and its not the reason why im asking the question so its slightly irrelevant I can come back to it when my mind is more clear.
