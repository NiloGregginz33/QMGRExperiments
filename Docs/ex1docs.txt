So this was actually after I asked a question on stack exchange about quantum computing, answered a protected question by asking a question, realized what this meant and ran with it.

# This is basically to test if charge is included in the information leaked by hawking radiation
# We do this by "injecting" charge of an "uncollapsable" wavefunction into a simulated black holes then seeing if it affects the content
# of the information in the hawking radiation over many runs and see what comes out. We are going to be seeing
# if bells inequality or the entanglement entropy.
