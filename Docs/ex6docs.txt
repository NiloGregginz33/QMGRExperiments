Measurement Results:
{'1010': 2024, '0000': 2007, '0111': 2085, '1101': 2076}

Subsystem Entropies:
Qubit 0: Entropy = 1.0000
Qubit 1: Entropy = 1.0000
Qubit 2: Entropy = 1.0000
Qubit 3: Entropy = 1.0000


This attempt to break into subsystems was just an organizational thing at that time, but paying attention to subsytem entropy does give a clearer view
