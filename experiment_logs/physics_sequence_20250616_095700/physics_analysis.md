    ## Temporal Injection Analysis
    
    Entropy scaling exponent: 0.117
Average mutual information: 0.375
Maximum mutual information: 0.999
Strong long-range correlations detected
Consistent with emergent geometric structure
    
    ### Physics Implications:
    1. The temporal injection pattern shows how quantum entanglement can give rise to emergent time-like structures
    2. The observed entropy scaling suggests a connection to the holographic principle
    3. The mutual information structure indicates potential geometric encoding of temporal relationships
