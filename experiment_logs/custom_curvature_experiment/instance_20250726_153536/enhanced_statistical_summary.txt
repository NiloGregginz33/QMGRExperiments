ENHANCED THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------
1. Geodesic Distance Analysis:
   - Isomap provides geodesic distances that respect manifold structure
   - Reduces distortion from Euclidean approximations
   - Better preserves intrinsic geometry of the quantum system

2. Enhanced MI Decay Analysis:
   - Exponential decay with geodesic distances suggests holographic behavior
   - Decay constant λ characterizes the correlation length
   - Embedding stress validates geometric reconstruction quality

3. Geometric Emergence:
   - MI-geodesic distance correlation reveals emergent geometric structure
   - Curved geometry shows different decay characteristics than Euclidean
   - Results support the holographic principle with improved methodology

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK:
----------------------------------------
1. Need full MI matrix for complete geodesic analysis
