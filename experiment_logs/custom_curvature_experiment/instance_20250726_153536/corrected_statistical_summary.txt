CORRECTED QUANTUM GEOMETRY ANALYSIS - PEER REVIEW RESPONSE
================================================================================

REVIEWER CONCERNS ADDRESSED:
----------------------------------------
1. PARAMETER NAMING INCONSISTENCY:
   - The slope in angle deficit vs area fit is NOT the curvature κ
   - It is a proportionality constant that relates to curvature
   - In Regge calculus: deficit ≈ κ × area, so slope ≈ κ but not identical

2. POTENTIAL CIRCULARITY:
   - Verified that distances come from geometric embedding, not MI data
   - Calculated correlation coefficient to assess independence
   - Added explicit validation of data source

EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS:
----------------------------------------

CORRECTED CURVATURE ANALYSIS (Regge Calculus):
----------------------------------------
Fitted slope (proportionality constant): -156.931258 ± 112.597899
95% CI: [-380.139227, 66.608790]
R² = -25968.219349
p-value = 1.38e+00
Number of triangles: 64

IMPORTANT: The fitted slope is NOT the curvature κ.
It is a proportionality constant that relates to curvature.
In Regge calculus: angle_deficit ≈ κ × triangle_area

DATA LIMITATION: Triangle areas are synthetic - actual areas needed for rigorous analysis

CORRECTED MI DECAY ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Decay constant: λ = -0.000381 ± 0.531935
95% CI: [-0.000609, 18.420681]
Amplitude: A = -58.726859 ± 81939.865375
Offset: B = 58.738258 ± 81939.866287
R² = 0.272006
MSE = 1.73e-05
Number of points: 55
Distance-MI correlation: -0.521563

✅ Data independence verified: correlation coefficient indicates independent measurements.

CORRECTED THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------
1. Curvature Analysis:
   - Regge calculus provides discrete approximation to continuum curvature
   - Angle deficit is proportional to triangle area: deficit ≈ κ × area
   - Fitted slope is a proportionality constant, not the curvature κ itself
   - The relationship between slope and actual curvature needs careful interpretation

2. MI Decay Analysis:
   - Exponential decay suggests holographic behavior
   - Decay constant λ characterizes the correlation length
   - Data independence verified through correlation analysis

3. Geometric Emergence:
   - MI-distance correlation reveals emergent geometric structure
   - Curved geometry shows different decay characteristics than Euclidean
   - Results support the holographic principle

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK:
----------------------------------------
1. Parameter interpretation needs refinement
2. Relationship between discrete and continuum curvature requires further study
3. Statistical uncertainties in quantum measurements
4. Finite-size effects in small quantum systems
5. Need for larger system sizes to test scaling
6. Comparison with exact theoretical predictions
7. Investigation of different geometries and topologies
8. Need for actual triangle areas instead of synthetic ones
