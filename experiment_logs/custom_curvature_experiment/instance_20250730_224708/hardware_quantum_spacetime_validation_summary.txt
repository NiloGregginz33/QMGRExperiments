HARDWARE QUANTUM SPACETIME VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================================================

OVERALL QUANTUM SPACETIME SCORE: 0.1791
ASSESSMENT: ❌ PRIMARILY CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:
------------------------------

1. Bell Inequality Violation: ❌ NOT VIOLATED
   Bell correlation: 0.0060
   Violations: 0

2. Quantum State Tomography: ❌ CLASSICAL
   Purity: 0.0007
   Coherence strength: 0.0000

3. Entanglement Witness: ✅ ENTANGLED
   Total violations: 4

4. Quantum Coherence: ✅ COHERENT
   Superposition strength: 0.6862

5. Causal Structure: ✅ VALID
   Light cone violations: 0

6. Holographic Principle: ✅ CONSISTENT
   Bulk reconstruction quality: 1.0000

CONCLUSION:
--------------------
❌ PRIMARILY CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS
   The system shows minimal 
   quantum signatures compatible with emergent spacetime.
   Hardware noise may be limiting quantum effects.

HARDWARE CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------
- Real quantum hardware has noise and decoherence
- Measurement counts only provide partial quantum information
- Strong quantum effects may be masked by hardware limitations
- Consider error mitigation techniques for improved results
