CTC Geometry Experiment Summary
================================

Theoretical Background:
This experiment simulates a Closed Timelike Curve (CTC) geometry using a quantum circuit. It investigates how feedback loops and time-like evolution affect entanglement and emergent geometry.

Methodology:
A 4-qubit quantum circuit is constructed with a feedback loop structure. Mutual information is computed between qubits, and MDS is used to visualize the emergent geometry.

Results:
Results saved in: experiment_logs/ctc_geometry

Conclusion:
The experiment demonstrates how CTC-like structures influence quantum entanglement and emergent geometry, providing insights into the interplay between quantum mechanics and spacetime structure.
