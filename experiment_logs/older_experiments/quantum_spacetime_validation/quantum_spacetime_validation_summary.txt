QUANTUM SPACETIME VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================================================

OVERALL QUANTUM SPACETIME SCORE: 0.1000
ASSESSMENT: ❌ CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:
------------------------------

1. Bell Inequality Violation: ❌ NOT VIOLATED
   Max violation: 0.0000

2. Quantum State Tomography: ❌ CLASSICAL
   Purity: 0.0000
   Coherence strength: 0.0000

3. Entanglement Witness: ❌ NOT ENTANGLED
   Total violations: 0

4. Quantum Coherence: ❌ INCOHERENT
   Superposition strength: 0.0000

5. Causal Structure: ✅ VALID
   Light cone violations: 0

6. Holographic Principle: ❌ INCONSISTENT
   Bulk reconstruction quality: 0.0000

CONCLUSION:
--------------------
❌ PRIMARILY CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS
   The system appears to be generating classical geometric
   correlations rather than quantum emergent spacetime.
   Consider enhancing quantum features in the circuit design.
