Emergent Spacetime Experiment Summary
====================================

Device: simulator
Shots: 100

Theoretical Background:
This experiment explores how quantum entanglement gives rise to emergent spacetime geometry. By analyzing mutual information and geometric embeddings, it probes the relationship between quantum information and geometry.

Methodology:
A quantum circuit is simulated over multiple timesteps. Mutual information matrices are computed, and MDS is used to extract geometric features. Entropy, curvature, and distance are tracked over time.

Results:
Results saved in: experiment_logs/emergent_spacetime_simulator

Conclusion:
The experiment demonstrates how quantum entanglement patterns can be mapped to emergent geometric structures, supporting the idea that spacetime geometry is encoded in quantum information.
