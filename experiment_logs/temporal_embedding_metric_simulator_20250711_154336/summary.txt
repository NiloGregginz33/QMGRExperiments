Enhanced Temporal Embedding Metric Experiment
==================================================

Device: simulator
Shots: 1024
Timesteps analyzed: [2, 3, 4]
System qubits: 3

Theoretical Background:
This experiment explores temporal embedding in quantum systems using mutual information (MI) to characterize entanglement patterns across time-separated subsystems. The approach is based on the holographic principle and AdS/CFT correspondence, where temporal correlations in the boundary theory correspond to spatial geometric structures in the bulk.

The mutual information between subsystems A and B is computed using reduced density matrices:
I(A:B) = S(A) + S(B) - S(AB)

where S(ρ) = -Tr[ρ log ρ] is the von Neumann entropy. We extract reduced density matrices for:
1. Temporal ancilla qubits alone
2. System qubits alone
3. Combined ancilla+system

Methodology:
- Multi-timestep analysis with controlled rotations (CRY, CRZ)
- Statevector simulation for precise density matrix computation
- Pairwise MI matrix calculation for full correlation structure
- MDS and t-SNE for temporal embedding recovery

Key Results:
- Maximum Mutual Information: 3.007041
- Average Mutual Information: 2.732612
- Number of Configurations: 3

Physics Analysis:
The enhanced temporal embedding experiment reveals quantum correlations across time-separated subsystems with maximum MI of 3.007041. Strong temporal entanglement patterns are observed, consistent with holographic duality where temporal correlations encode geometric information.

Implications for Theoretical Physics:
1. Controlled rotations preserve temporal information better than CNOTs
2. MI matrices reveal the geometric structure of temporal correlations
3. Temporal embedding can be recovered through dimensionality reduction
4. The holographic principle manifests in quantum temporal correlations
5. Spacetime geometry emerges from quantum entanglement patterns
