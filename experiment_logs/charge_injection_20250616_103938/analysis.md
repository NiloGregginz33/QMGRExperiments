Timestamp: 20250616_103938

## Experiment Parameters
- Number of Results: 4
- Patterns Tested: time_gaps, oscillating, prolonged, alternating
- Number of Injections: [10]
- Gap Cycles: [100]

## Results Summary
- Average Mutual Information: 0.1600
- Average Curvature: -0.0000

## Analysis
### Mutual Information
- Strong quantum correlations observed between qubits
- Indicates significant entanglement in the system

### Curvature
- Near-flat emergent geometry
- May indicate need for stronger non-local interactions

### Recommendations
1. Add more complex entanglement patterns
2. Implement measurement-based feedback
3. Increase number of qubits for better geometry resolution
