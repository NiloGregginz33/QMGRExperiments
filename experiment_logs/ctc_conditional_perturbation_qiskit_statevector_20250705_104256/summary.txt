CTC Conditional Perturbation Experiment Summary
==============================================

Device: statevector
Shots: 1024

Theoretical Background:
This experiment simulates a Closed Timelike Curve (CTC) geometry with and without a conditional or unconditional perturbation. It investigates how anomalies or interventions affect the entanglement and emergent geometry of the CTC loop.

Methodology:
A 4-qubit quantum circuit is constructed with a feedback loop structure. A perturbation (X, RX(pi), or CX(0,target)) is optionally applied. Mutual information, MDS geometry, and entropy are computed for both standard and perturbed cases.

Results:
Results saved in: experiment_logs/ctc_conditional_perturbation_qiskit_statevector_20250705_104256

Conclusion:
The experiment demonstrates how local interventions in a CTC-like structure can alter the entanglement and emergent geometry, and tests the loop's sensitivity to collapse and self-consistency.
