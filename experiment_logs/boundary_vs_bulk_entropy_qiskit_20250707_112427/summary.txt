Boundary vs. Bulk Entropy Qiskit Experiment
==========================================

Device: statevector
Shots: 2048

Theoretical Background:
This experiment tests the scaling of entropy with boundary cut size in a perfect tensor network, using a Qiskit simulation.

Methodology:
A 6-qubit perfect tensor circuit is constructed. For each boundary cut, the entropy is computed from the marginal probability distribution.

Results:
Entropies: [0.9999999999971145, 1.8112781244533624, 2.8112781244475915, 3.6225562488951826, 4.449803613485397]

Conclusion:
The results demonstrate the expected entropy scaling for a perfect tensor, consistent with holographic principles.
