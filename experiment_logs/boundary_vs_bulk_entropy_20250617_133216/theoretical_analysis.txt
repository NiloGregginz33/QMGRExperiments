        Theoretical Analysis (Holographic Context):
        1. The observed entropy scaling with cut size suggests a linear relationship, consistent with the holographic principle.
        2. The perfect tensor structure implies that bulk information is fully encoded in the boundary, supporting the AdS/CFT correspondence.
        3. The validity of entropy values across different cut sizes indicates robust holographic encoding, where boundary degrees of freedom mirror bulk geometry.
        4. Implications for Quantum Gravity: The results suggest that the emergent spacetime geometry is encoded in the entanglement structure of the boundary theory.
        5. Connection to String Theory: The observed entropy scaling and perfect tensor structure are consistent with predictions from string theory, where the holographic principle plays a crucial role in understanding the relationship between bulk and boundary theories.
