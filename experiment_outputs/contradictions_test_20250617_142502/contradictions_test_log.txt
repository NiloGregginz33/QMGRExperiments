Test the holographic principle with disconnected bulk.
2025-06-17 14:25:02,126 - contradictions_test - INFO - Methodology:
Prepare two separate entangled pairs, compute boundary entropy.

2025-06-17 14:25:02,127 - contradictions_test - INFO - Analysis:
Disconnected bulk leads to reduced boundary entropy.

Holographic principle is violated when bulk-bulk connections are missing.
