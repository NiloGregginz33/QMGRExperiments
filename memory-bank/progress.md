## What Works
- Dimensional Reduction Geometry Experiment: Demonstrated emergent geometry from quantum mutual information in multi-qubit systems, supporting holographic principles.
- Modular Flow Geometry Experiment: Investigated modular flow in quantum subsystems, revealing its role in quantum geometry and information structure.
- Unified Causal Geometry Experiment: Linked quantum causal order to entropy and emergent geometry through quantum switch and spacetime models.
- Boundary vs. Bulk Entropy Qiskit Experiment: Validated entropy scaling and holographic principles in simulated quantum systems.
- CTC Conditional Perturbation Experiments: Showed how interventions in CTC-like circuits affect entanglement and emergent geometry, demonstrating sensitivity and self-consistency.
- Curved Geometry Experiments (Qiskit/IBM): Provided insight into the interplay between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry by comparing flat and curved spacetime effects on quantum information.
