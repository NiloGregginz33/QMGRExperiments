## Current Work Focus
- Ongoing analysis and theoretical interpretation of recent quantum geometry and holography experiments.

## Recent Changes
- Added and summarized results from the following experiments:
  - Dimensional Reduction Geometry: Empirical support for emergent geometry from entanglement.
  - Modular Flow Geometry: Insights into modular flow's role in quantum information structure.
  - Unified Causal Geometry: Linked quantum causal order to entropy and emergent geometry.
  - Boundary vs. Bulk Entropy: Validated entropy scaling and holographic principles.
  - CTC Conditional Perturbation: Demonstrated CTC sensitivity and self-consistency.
  - Curved Geometry: Provided insight into quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry interplay.
