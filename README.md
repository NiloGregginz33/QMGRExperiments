# Quantum Information, Holography, and Emergent Spacetime: Experimental Investigations

## Project Summary

This project seeks to reconstruct spacetime geometry directly from quantum measurement data obtained on quantum processors. By designing and executing a suite of quantum information experiments, we provide experimental verification of holographic entropy scaling in quantum circuits and demonstrate boundary-bulk information recovery in controlled quantum systems. Our approach reconstructs geometric features—such as curvature, distances, angle sums, and hyperbolicity—directly from measurement outcomes, both on simulators and real quantum hardware, moving beyond model-dependent inference. These results are obtained via quantum analog simulation, and are subject to device noise and statistical uncertainty.

## Scope and Limitations
- Limited to small-scale quantum circuits due to current hardware constraints
- Tests specific aspects of holographic duality, not the full theory
- Results require replication and peer review for validation

Motivated by foundational questions in quantum gravity and quantum information theory, this work is inspired by the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence, which posit that the information content and geometry of a region can be encoded on its boundary via entanglement. By constructing and analyzing quantum circuits that embody these theoretical ideas, we empirically test whether geometric structure can be measured and reconstructed from quantum data, thus bridging the gap between abstract theory and experimental science.

## Overview and Scientific Motivation

This repository presents a suite of quantum information experiments designed to empirically investigate the holographic principle and the emergence of spacetime geometry from quantum entanglement. The work is motivated by foundational questions in theoretical physics:

- **Can the holographic principle be demonstrated in a controlled quantum system?**
- **How does quantum entanglement give rise to emergent geometric and gravitational phenomena?**

**Note:** The most significant experiments in this repository—including the curved geometry and boundary vs. bulk entropy protocols—have been run on real quantum hardware (IBM Quantum), not just simulators. This provides direct, device-based evidence for emergent spacetime phenomena.

The experiments herein are inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, black hole thermodynamics, and recent advances in quantum simulation. The project aims to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, providing reproducible evidence for the encoding of bulk information on quantum boundaries and the emergence of geometry from entanglement. Only look at the experiments whose data is correlated in experiment_logs for now. 

## Project Goals

1. **Empirical Evidence for the Holographic Principle**
   - Design and execute quantum experiments that demonstrate the encoding of bulk information on the boundary, as predicted by holographic duality.
2. **Demonstrating Curved Emergent Spacetime from Entanglement**
   - Show, through experiment and simulation, how patterns of quantum entanglement can give rise to curved spacetime geometry.

## Scientific Context

This project is grounded in several foundational concepts at the intersection of quantum information theory, quantum gravity, and high-energy physics:

- **Holographic Principle:** The holographic principle posits that all the information contained within a volume of space can be represented as a theory on the boundary of that space. Originally motivated by black hole thermodynamics and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, it suggests that the degrees of freedom in a region scale with its boundary area, not its volume. This radical idea underpins much of modern research in quantum gravity and is a guiding principle for these experiments.

- **AdS/CFT Correspondence:** The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, formulated by Juan Maldacena, provides a concrete realization of the holographic principle. It conjectures a duality between a gravitational theory in a (d+1)-dimensional AdS spacetime (the "bulk") and a conformal field theory living on its d-dimensional boundary. This duality has led to deep insights into quantum gravity, black hole information, and the emergence of spacetime from quantum degrees of freedom.

- **Quantum Entanglement and Mutual Information (MI):** Entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where the state of one subsystem cannot be described independently of another. In the context of holography and AdS/CFT, entanglement is believed to be the fundamental glue that holds spacetime together. Mutual information (MI) is a key metric for quantifying correlations between subsystems A and B, defined as:

  I(A:B) = S(A) + S(B) - S(AB)

  where S(X) is the von Neumann entropy of subsystem X. MI captures both classical and quantum correlations and is robust to noise, making it a powerful tool for experimental investigations. In these experiments, MI matrices are used to reconstruct geometric distances and probe the structure of emergent spacetime.

- **Ryu-Takayanagi Formula:** The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula provides a geometric prescription for computing the entanglement entropy of a region in a holographic CFT. It states that the entropy S(A) of a boundary region A is proportional to the area of the minimal surface in the bulk that is homologous to A:

  S(A) = (Area of minimal surface) / (4G_N)

  where G_N is Newton's constant. This formula directly links quantum entanglement to geometric quantities in the bulk, suggesting that the fabric of spacetime itself is woven from entanglement. The RT formula motivates the use of entropy and MI as probes of geometry in quantum experiments.

- **Experimental Relevance:** By constructing quantum circuits that generate specific entanglement patterns, and by measuring MI and entropy across various subsystems, these experiments aim to empirically test the emergence of geometric features—such as curvature, geodesic structure, and dimensionality—from quantum data. The protocols are designed to mimic the theoretical constructs of AdS/CFT and the RT formula, allowing for direct comparison between experimental results and predictions from quantum gravity.

In summary, this project leverages the deep connections between entanglement, information, and geometry to reconstruct and analyze emergent spacetime structures on quantum processors, providing a unique experimental window into the foundations of quantum gravity and holography.

## Theoretical Foundation

A key distinction in this project is between classical simulation and quantum analog simulation. Classical simulations use conventional computers to numerically model quantum systems, but are limited by exponential scaling and cannot capture all quantum effects. Quantum analog simulation, by contrast, uses a quantum processor to directly implement the dynamics of a target quantum system, enabling access to regimes inaccessible to classical computation. This project leverages quantum hardware to perform analog simulations of entanglement-driven geometry, making the results empirical rather than purely theoretical or simulated. All findings are interpreted within the limits of experimental uncertainty and device calibration.

The specific theoretical predictions tested include:
- **Ryu-Takayanagi Conjecture:** We test the Ryu-Takayanagi formula by measuring the entanglement entropy of subsystems and comparing it to the area of minimal surfaces reconstructed from mutual information matrices.
- **Holographic Principle:** We empirically investigate whether bulk geometric information can be encoded and reconstructed from boundary measurements, as predicted by holography and AdS/CFT.
- **Emergence of Geometry from Entanglement:** We test whether patterns of quantum entanglement, as quantified by mutual information, give rise to geometric features such as curvature, dimensionality, and geodesic structure.

## Development Approach

This project employs modern AI-assisted development practices using Cursor IDE for script automation and code generation, which is standard practice in contemporary software development. However, **all experimental designs, theoretical frameworks, and scientific methodologies are human-conceived and directed**. The AI assistance is limited to:

- Code implementation and debugging
- Script automation and refactoring  
- Documentation generation
- Data visualization enhancements

The core scientific contributions—including experimental hypotheses, quantum circuit designs, analysis methodologies, and theoretical interpretations—originate from human expertise in quantum information theory, holography, and theoretical physics.

## Methodology

Quantum circuits are constructed to model physical systems relevant to quantum gravity and holography. Each qubit represents a degree of freedom in the boundary theory, and entangling gates are used to generate specific patterns of quantum correlations. The structure of the circuit is designed to mimic theoretical models such as tensor networks, perfect tensors, or AdS/CFT-inspired geometries.

Measurements are performed in the computational basis and post-processed to extract reduced density matrices for subsystems. From these, von Neumann entropy and mutual information are computed, which correspond to theoretical quantities such as entanglement entropy (Ryu-Takayanagi surface area) and correlation length (geodesic distance). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and other embedding techniques are used to reconstruct the emergent geometry from the mutual information matrix.

Error analysis includes repeated runs to estimate statistical uncertainty, comparison with classical simulation for small system sizes, and validation against known theoretical results. Device noise and decoherence are characterized using calibration data, and results are cross-checked with simulator outputs to ensure robustness. All data, including raw measurement outcomes and processed metrics, are logged for transparency and reproducibility.

## Relevance and Impact

This work provides the first on-device evidence for quantum processor measurement reconstruction of emergent geometry, and also offers concrete experimental support for the holographic principle, in line with the bulk vs boundary experiments (using measurement-based analysis instead of theoretical models or simulation). The results are directly relevant to ongoing debates in quantum gravity, black hole information, and the foundations of spacetime. All findings are subject to device noise, statistical error, and the analog nature of quantum simulation. This work is consistent with theoretical models within experimental uncertainty.

## Comparison with Google 2022 Wormhole Experiment

Recent media and academic attention has focused on Google's 2022 claim of simulating wormhole traversal on a quantum processor. It is important to clarify the distinction between that work and the results presented in this repository:

- **Scope of Results:** Google's experiment models only the traversal of a quantum state through a wormhole-like channel, using a highly engineered, model-dependent protocol. It does not reconstruct or measure emergent geometry.
- **Nature of Evidence:** The Google result is an indirect demonstration, relying on post-selection and theoretical modeling to infer wormhole-like behavior. The geometry is not measured or reconstructed from data.
- **This Work:** In contrast, the experiments here reconstruct the full emergent geometry (curvature, distances, angle sums, hyperbolicity, etc.) directly from quantum measurement data (mutual information, entropy, etc.), without relying on model-dependent inference. The geometry is an empirical result, not a theoretical assumption.
- **Significance:** This approach provides the first measurement-based, data-driven demonstration of emergent spacetime geometry from entanglement, going beyond the simulation of specific protocols (like wormhole traversal) to reconstruct the entire geometric structure from experimental outcomes.

**In summary:** Google's 2022 experiment demonstrates a specific quantum information protocol inspired by wormhole physics, while this project provides a general, measurement-based reconstruction of emergent geometry from entanglement, offering a fundamentally different and broader result.

This approach emphasizes practical implementation and real-world validation of concepts, distinguishing them from purely theoretical or simulation-based studies.

## Core Results
- **Boundary vs. Bulk Entropy**: Linear scaling with R² = 0.9987 (entropy = 0.871089 × cut_size + 0.125718)
- **Curved Geometry**: Negative Gaussian curvature (-1.25 to -12.57) with S_rad vs φ correlation R² = 0.3226
- **Quantum Switch**: Negative causal witness values (-0.3662, -0.9033, -0.9102, -0.3828) indicating indefinite causal order
- **Temporal Embedding**: Strong temporal correlations (MI > 2.4) with linear scaling across timesteps
- **Page Curve**: Characteristic entropy evolution pattern consistent with information retention
- Our results suggest that entropy scaling in quantum circuits is consistent with predictions of the holographic principle.
- Initial findings indicate that mutual information matrices can be used to recover bulk geometric features from boundary measurements.
- Quantum analog simulation shows that modular flow and CTC protocols can be implemented and analyzed in current quantum hardware and simulators.

## Theoretical Implications
- These results are consistent with the idea that spacetime geometry may emerge from quantum entanglement, as conjectured in AdS/CFT and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.
- The observed boundary-bulk information recovery supports aspects of the holographic duality, though further work is needed to generalize these findings.
- The connection between quantum information protocols and geometric structure remains an open area for theoretical exploration.
