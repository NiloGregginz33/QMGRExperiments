There are a lot of the resolutions to the black hole information paradox. I've heard of preserving information on the hawking radiation. So I wondered what would happen if i sent some entangled pairs into a simulated black hole while preventing wavefunction collapse and just looked at how the charge of what i put in affected the charge of the information out. 

I dont know if what im saying is going to make sense, but I started to wonder about this question because most of the electrons mass comes from the higgs field if not all of it. I wonder if the Hawking radiation has a charge to it if u "inject" it with charged particles, how would that change the charge of the hawking radiation? If black holes only have charge mass and angular momentum I just made a guess and thought the charge should be conserved too. I think if charge is conserved because we think that EM radiation, strong, and weak forces unify, maybe that information is preserved as well though I am not completely sure if electric charge is special because of the fact black holes dont appear to have a property like color charge. Im going to keep running experiments as I think of questions. As far as I know, this experiment implies charge is a property that is conserved with hawking radiation.

I am not a physict and do not know if this is a reasonable thing to say I would love feedback ultimately im just trying to learn
