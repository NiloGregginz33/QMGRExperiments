# Quantum Holography Experiments Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the quantum experiments performed to test the holographic principle and related phenomena using Qiskit and local simulators. Each experiment is run with logging and analysis of its implications for theoretical physics and our understanding of reality.

## 1. Holographic Principle Demonstration
**Purpose:**
- To demonstrate that information in a quantum system's bulk can be encoded on its boundary, as predicted by the holographic principle.

**Method:**
- Prepare a maximally entangled state (GHZ-like) on 6 qubits.
- Measure all qubits and compute the entropy of the boundary.
- Use Qiskit Sampler and Session primitives with a local AerSimulator backend.

**Implications:**
- Confirms that quantum circuits can model the encoding of bulk information on a lower-dimensional boundary.
- Supports the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and entanglement entropy in emergent spacetime scenarios.
- Suggests quantum information theory is a powerful tool for probing the foundations of spacetime and gravity.

## 2. Temporal Charge Injection Experiment
**Purpose:**
- To explore how injecting quantum information (charge) with temporal patterning affects boundary entropy and information flow.

**Method:**
- Sweep a parameter (phi) for RX rotation on the bulk qubit.
- For each value, prepare the circuit, measure all qubits, and compute the entropy.
- Use Qiskit Sampler and Session primitives with a local AerSimulator backend.

**Implications:**
- Shows that entropy oscillates with injected charge, demonstrating information flow.
- The system maintains holographic properties despite charge injection.
- Provides a testbed for studying dynamical information transfer in quantum systems.
