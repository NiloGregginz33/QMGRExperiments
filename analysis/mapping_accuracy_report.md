- **Result**: Poor power law fit (R² < 0.1)

### 3. **Consistency Analysis** ❌

**Geometry-Specific Patterns:**
- Hyperbolic geometry: r = -0.051 (p = 0.750) - No significant correlation
- **Result**: Inconsistent across geometry types

**Curvature Regime Analysis:**
- Low curvature (k < 3): Mean MI variance = 0.0138 ± 0.0276
- Medium curvature (3 ≤ k < 10): Mean MI variance = 0.0161 ± 0.0374
- High curvature (k ≥ 10): Mean MI variance = 0.0071 ± 0.0151
- **Result**: No clear pattern across curvature regimes

### 4. **Data Quality Assessment** ⚠️

**Data Completeness:**
- Total experiments: 118
- Valid MI data: 45 (38.1%)
- Valid distance data: 50 (42.4%)
- **Issue**: Low data completeness limits analysis

**Measurement Uncertainty:**
- Coefficient of variation: 2.38 (very high variability)
- 95% Confidence Interval: [0.0053, 0.0216]
- **Issue**: High measurement uncertainty

## Key Findings

### 1. **No Systematic Relationship Detected**

The analysis reveals **no systematic relationship** between the input curvature parameter `k` and the reconstructed geometric properties:

- **Correlation strength**: 0.0% (no significant correlations)
- **Predictive power**: 0.0% (models perform worse than random)
- **Consistency**: 0.0% (no consistent patterns across geometries)

### 2. **High Variability in Measurements**

- **Coefficient of variation**: 2.38 indicates extremely high variability
- **Data completeness**: Only 38.1% of experiments have valid MI data
- **Measurement uncertainty**: Wide confidence intervals suggest unreliable measurements

### 3. **Potential Issues Identified**

1. **Data Quality Issues:**
   - Many experiments missing MI or distance data
   - High variability in measurements
   - Possible measurement errors or systematic biases

2. **Mapping Complexity:**
   - The relationship may be non-linear or multi-dimensional
   - Simple linear models may be inadequate
   - Other factors may dominate the geometric reconstruction

3. **Experimental Design:**
   - Curvature parameter may not be the primary driver
   - Quantum noise may overwhelm geometric signals
   - Insufficient data points for reliable analysis

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. **Challenges to Emergent Geometry Hypothesis**

The poor accuracy suggests that:
- **Input curvature may not directly control emergent geometry**
- **Other factors may dominate the geometric reconstruction**
- **The mapping may be more complex than a simple parameter relationship**

### 2. **Quantum-Classical Interface**

The results indicate:
- **Quantum measurements may be too noisy for geometric reconstruction**
- **The quantum-to-geometric transition may require different approaches**
- **Emergent geometry may not be captured by simple MI patterns**

### 3. **Holographic Principle Limitations**

The poor mapping suggests:
- **Boundary-bulk correspondence may be more subtle**
- **Mutual information alone may be insufficient**
- **Additional geometric quantities may be needed**

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**

1. **Improve Data Quality:**

   - Include more geometry types (spherical, euclidean)

2. **Measurement Protocols:**
   - Increase measurement precision
   - Use error mitigation techniques
   - Implement better quantum state tomography

3. **Theoretical Refinement:**

## Conclusions

### **Current State: Low Accuracy Mapping**

The curvature mapping analysis reveals **fundamental limitations** in our current approach:

1. **No systematic relationship** between input curvature and reconstructed geometry
2. **Poor predictive power** across all tested models
3. **High measurement uncertainty** and data quality issues
4. **Inconsistent patterns** across different geometries and curvature regimes

### **Theoretical Impact**

These results suggest that:
- **Emergent geometry from quantum entanglement may be more complex than anticipated**
- **Simple parameter mappings may be insufficient for quantum gravity**
- **Additional theoretical and experimental work is needed**

### **Path Forward**

While the current mapping shows low accuracy, this analysis provides valuable insights for future research:

1. **Identify the limitations** of current approaches
2. **Guide experimental improvements** and data collection
3. **Motivate theoretical refinements** in geometric reconstruction
4. **Establish benchmarks** for measuring progress

The 9.5% accuracy score serves as a **baseline** for future improvements and highlights the challenges in quantum geometric reconstruction.
