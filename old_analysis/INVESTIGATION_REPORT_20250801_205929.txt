CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================
[WARNING] Most solutions are trivial (maximally mixed states)
This suggests our algorithm is not finding interesting quantum states

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
1. Modify algorithm to avoid trivial solutions
2. Use different initial conditions
3. Implement constraints to find non-trivial fixed points
